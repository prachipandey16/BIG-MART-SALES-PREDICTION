# BIG-MART-SALES-PREDICTION

This project focuses on predicting sales for Big Mart using machine learning. By leveraging historical sales data, we aim to develop accurate predictive models that can help optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall business planning.

## Key Features:

*   **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
*   **Model Training:** Implementing and training three different machine learning models:
    *   Decision Tree Regressor
    *   Random Forest Regressor
    *   XGBoost Regressor
*   **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using appropriate regression metrics ( RMSE, MAE, R-squared).
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters to achieve the best possible results.

## Technologies Used:

*   Python
*   Pandas
*   NumPy
*   Scikit-learn
*   XGBoost

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the Big Mart Sales dataset. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivan118/big-mart-sales-prediction-datasets)
